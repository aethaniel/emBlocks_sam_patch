Em::Blocks_sam_patch
==================

Patch to provide some Atmel SAM devices into Em::Blocks for L.A.B. trainings.

It is preliminary and submitted to evolutions: use at your own risk ;-)

How to make it work:
- Download Em::Blocks from http://www.emblocks.org/web/downloads-main, curent version is 1.41.
- Install Em::Blocks (usually it installs itself into C:\Program Files (x86)\EmBlocks\1.41)
- Take this patch and copy the folder hierarchy into C:\Program Files (x86)\EmBlocks\1.41
- Run Em::Blocks
- You should see the option 'Create a new project' in the 'Start here' main page, click on it
- Select the 'Atmel-ARM' option and follow the steps
